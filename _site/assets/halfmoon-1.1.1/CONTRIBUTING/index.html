<h1>Contributing to Halfmoon</h1>
<p>Please read this short document if you want to contribute to Halfmoon.</p>
<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>Before getting to the issues and pull requests, it is important to understand what the framework is trying to do.</p>
<p>Halfmoon's stated goal is really simple - create a customizable frontend framework, with a built-in dark mode, that is great for building dashboards and tools. However, our other goals are more implicit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything has to be <strong>super functional and snappy</strong>. Ideally, that means no performance issues and just consistently good execution.</li>
<li>Everything has to <strong>look good</strong> as well, and have a <strong>single, consistent style</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important thing here is building a <strong>really good (looking) framework that also works very well</strong>, and that should always be the top priority.</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>Please keep the following things in mind when raising issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature requests are welcome. However, please make sure that the feature you are requesting falls under the scope of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> post personal support questions as issues. For those, use this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/halfmoon">tag on Stack Overflow</a>.</li>
<li>When raising an issue, please be as thorough as possible. For possible bugs, reproducible code is always a great sign.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pull requests</h2>
<p><strong>Please ask first</strong> before you put in work for a pull request. Things are constantly being worked on, and it is very difficult to share everything publicly in a meaningful way. So asking lets us avoid working on the same thing, or worse, someone putting in a lot of work for a PR that does not fit into the scope of the project. Please do not take this the wrong way; at this stage, the project needs strong leadership to become something special.</p>
<p>The best way to ask is through email: <a href="mailto:hey.halfmoon@gmail.com">hey.halfmoon@gmail.com</a>. I am always open to proper discussions about the framework, especially when it comes to contributions and pull requests.</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>Any contribution you make will fall under the license being used by the framework: <a href="https://www.gethalfmoon.com/license/">MIT license</a>.</p>
